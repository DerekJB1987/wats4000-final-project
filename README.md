# wats4000-final-project

> A Vue.js project
This project was intended to challenge the student to build a single page application using a JavaScript application framework. Your application should allow the user to submit some information and then fetch data from a third-party API. This project is a culmination of all the course outcomes: Development Tools, JavaScript Applications, and Software Architecture.

I selected the sunrise-sunset.org API that doesn't require an API key to import the times for a location determined by the latitude and longitude coordinates provided by the user. 

The API returns the following times: twilight start, sunrise, sunset, twilight end, day length, solar noon, start and end times for both nautical twilight and astronomical twilight.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
